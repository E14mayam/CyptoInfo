        <p>
          Blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it
          difficult or <br />
          impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system. A blockchain is
          essentially a <br />
          digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed
          across <br />
          the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain.

            <p>
              An NFT is a digital asset that represents real-world objects like
              art, <br />
              music, in-game items and videos. They are bought and sold online,
              frequently with cryptocurrency, <br />
              and they are generally encoded with the same underlying software
              as many cryptos.

              A cryptocurrency is an encrypted data string that denotes a unit
              of currency. <br />
              It is monitored and organized by a peer-to-peer network called a
              blockchain, <br />
              which also serves as a secure ledger of transactions, e.g.,
              buying, selling, <br />
              and transferring.

        <h1>WEB 3.0</h1>
        <p>
          Web 3 refers to an Internet that is made possible by decentralized
          networks, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. The new technology of these
          networks is the construction of platforms that no single business can
          control, but everyone can still trust. That is because every user and
          provider of these networks must follow the same set of strict code
          rules, known as consensus protocols. Like the previous version of the
          web, there was no single creator of Web 3. Instead, it has grown as a
          collaboration of different people and organizations building on each
          other. There is the Web3 Foundation, run by the founders of the
          Polkadot network. With Web 3, the network is distributed, so no single
          business manages it, and the dapps(Decentralized applications) built
          over the network are open. The openness of the web used means that no
          single group can control the data or restrict access. Anyone can build
          and connect with different dapps without permission from the central
          company.
